# Library System Microservices

A microservices-based library management system built with FastAPI.

## Architecture

This system consists of the following microservices:

| Service             | Port | Description                          |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| API Gateway         | 8000 | Central entry point for all requests |
| Book Service        | 8001 | Manages book inventory               |
| Member Service      | 8002 | Handles library members              |
| Borrow Service      | 8003 | Manages book borrowing               |
| Review Service      | 8004 | Handles book reviews                 |
